Automatic Number Plate Recogniser project for Uni using YOLOv8 and TesseractOCR. Used for Data science classes Machine Learning Techniques and Project of the first year. 
This is the whole folder that I used while working on the project, I uploaded all of the .py files as the main idea for the project was changing and developing.
The finished programs are: program_bez_segmentacije.py
                           program_sa_segmentacijom.py
Folders with the testing images and the results haven't been uploaded, program creates the needed folders and files when it runs. 
Training of the model is inside the .ipynb files.
Custom trained OCR files haven't been uploaded as they haven't been used in the paper in the end.
